We realized the last few years while taking a break, that what we started was an idea, a lifestyle that was bigger than us... It wasn’t about us anymore, it was about the riders that helped us succeed, the friends we made along the way, and the culture that we bred... We realized the last few years that our bonds and friendships were stronger than ever, they were never torn, we did not abandon one another, nor did we abandon our ideas, our principles, or our sense of community... Riding motorcycles brought us together and that bond is engrained in our soul, it flows in our veins... So we put this site together for you all to enjoy and keep the legacy of our accomplishments and the impact we made on the industry out there. Enjoy...
